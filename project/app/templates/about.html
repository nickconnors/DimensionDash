            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>Our first step is to give people the option to play against their friends which gives a 2D platformer a chance to be more enjoyable. 
                Creating fun and rigid obstacles to maneuver around diligently. 
                Providing levels for users to complete and advance. 
                Providing check points, this way would give the user a second chance to complete a certain obstacle that they may be lingering upon.</p>
